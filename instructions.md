 

Complete the RectangleManager class so that it implements the given Adjuster interface. The implementation should use the h and w parameters as the incremental amounts by which the oobject's current height and width are to be changed, respectively.

For example, if the original rectangle has width of 10 and height of 20, and the increments are 5 and 7 for width and height respectively, the new dimensions of the rectangle should be width of 15 and height of 27.
